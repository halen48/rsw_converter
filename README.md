A small script to convert new versions of RSW, GAT, and GND maps to older versions. The most stable version currently is 1.9. Please note that some RSM2 files may not render on the map. Also, be aware that RSM2 animations are not played through this conversion (likely due to some issue with RSM2 in relation to its new version). Some metadata about the maps is available in the ```meta_maps.json``` file.

Enjoy :)
